            <img ng-src="img/strobe-beacon-lights.png" alt="">
            <p>The anti-collision light consists of a red rotating beacon at the rear of the aircraft. The red beacon should be turned on anytime the engine is operating to inform anyone in close proximity to the danger of propeller blades and jet engine intakes.</p>
            <p>Turn red beacon (anti-collision light) on before starting engine.</p>
            <p>White strobe lights may also be included on the wingtips to further enhance anit-collision lighting. Turn strobe lights on before entering runway.</p>

        <h3>Navigation Lights</h3>
        <div>
            <img ng-src="img/navigation-lights.png" alt="">
            <p>Navigation lights alert other pilots where your aircraft is, and more importantly,
                        your aircraft's direction of travel.  These lights consist of a red light on the port (left) wingtip,
                        and a green light on the starboard (right) wingtip, each omitting in a 110 degree arc.
                        There is a white light on the tail of the aircraft that covers a wider area being 140 degrees.</p>
            <p>NAV lights should be ON any time the aircraft is moving.</p>

        <h3>Taxi and Landing Lights</h3>
        <div>
            <img ng-src="img/landing-taxi-lights.png" alt="">
            <p>Taxi lights provide a way of seeing what lies head while taxiing at the airport.  They are located either on the nose wheel strut / front empennage or on the wing structure.</p>
            <p>Taxi lights are not mandatory, and should be used as needed at pilots' discretion.</p>
            <p>Turn taxi lights off when aligned on runway prior to takeoff.</p>
                       
            <p>Co-located with the taxi lights is the landing lights.  This light provides illumination of the
                        runway during landing and aids in alerting ground personnel and other pilots of an approaching aircraft.</p>
            <p>Flash landing lights once before starting engine.</p>
            <p>Turn landing lights on when aligned on runway prior to takeoff, and on final approach to landing.</p>
            <p>Turn landing lights OFF at 200 ft AGL after takeoff, and upon clearing runway after landing.</p>
