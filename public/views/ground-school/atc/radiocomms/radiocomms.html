        <h3>1. Clearance Delivery</h3>
        <p>Clearance Delivery is an air traffic controller whose function is to coordinate with other ATC facilities and provide departing aircraft with an instrument flight clearance. The pilot of a departing aircraft calls clearance delivery, states the aircraft identification and destination, and requests an IFR clearance.</p>
        <p>The clearance delivery controller issues a clearance to the aircraft, providing the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Departure procedure -tells the pilot on what heading and at what altitude to depart from the airport.</li>
            <li>Route of flight - the route that the pilot is to follow in order to arrive at the destination.</li>
            <li>Altitude data - the initial altitude to be flown and the altitude to expect at a specified time, typically 10 minutes, after departure.</li>
            <li>Departure control frequency - the first frequency on which to contact the departure controller when the tower instructs a frequency change.</li>
            <li>Transponder code - the code to be entered in the transponder to assist radar equipped air traffic controllers in following the aircraft.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="pilot">Big Jet 345, Gate B7, Boeing 737 with information Q, QNH1006, request clearance.</div>
        <div class="atc">Big Jet 345, Metro Delivery, Cleared to Smallville, T1A departure, Squawk 3456</div>
        <p>Pilot communication can be adversely affected by simultaneous or continuous transmissions. There are times when the controller is not aware of a blocked transmission, but a pilot is. On hearing a simultaneous transmission it can be helpful if a pilot informs ATC that the transmission was BLOCKED.</p>

        <h3>2. Ground - Push back</h3>
        <p>Ground Control is a controller in the tower cab whose responsibility it is to instruct all aircraft on the movement area of the airport. After clearance delivery has issued the clearance to the flight, its corresponding flight progress strip is passed to the ground controller. Thus, when a pilot radios the ground controller, the ground controller already knows the aircraft's route of flight and can assign an appropriate runway for that route, depending on which runways are available and the wind and weather conditions then prevailing.</p>
        
        <div class="pilot">Metro Ground, Big Jet 345, Gate B7, ready for push back.</div>

        <div class="atc">Big Jet 345, Metro Ground, taxi to holding point A1, hold short of Runway 18, contact Metro Tower 119.20</div>
        <p>Communication is crucial to the safety of the flight during taxiing. Any mistake that causes the aircraft to enter a runway in error could be catastrophic. 
        All taxi clearances will contain a clearance limit, which is the point at which the aircraft must stop unless further permission to proceed is given. Complex or lengthy taxi clearances should be noted down by crews. Any instructions to HOLD, HOLD POSITION or HOLD SHORT OF, shall be read back in full using the appropriate phrase – HOLDING or HOLD SHORT OF.</p>

        <h3>4. Tower - Taxi on to runway and take off clearance</h3>
        <p>Local Control has the responsibility for instructing all airborne aircraft within the vicinity of the airport, including instructions for aircraft to takeoff and land. The local controller may have to coordinate with the departure and arrival controllers in sequencing arriving and departing aircraft, and with the ground controller to authorize aircraft to taxi on or across active runways.</p>

        <p>Avoid heading and flight level confusion by appending the word ‘degrees’ to headings. Flight levels below FL100 are referred to as two digit numbers (e.g. 'Climb flight level eight zero'). Special care should be taken when enunciating ‘zero zero’.</p>
